Accessibility:

Perceivability:
- Kept use of images, icons, video, audio and charts to a minimum to ensure most elements are easily perceived
- Text is used instead of images to preserve content and quality when zoomed in
- Color contrast is kept high between text content and the background to make text easily distinguishable
- Modal and dialog popups darken the rest of the page content to highlight themselves and make them easier to perceive

Operability:
- All page actions support keyboard operations in addition to mouse input, such as Arrow keys/Space for moving down the page, Tab to move between
  interactable elements, etc.
- Buttons support clicking and tapping as well as the Enter and Space keys
- No keyboard traps are set
- Use of headers, sections and footers improve the operability of the app
- Repeated content will use a skip link to bypass it
- No quickly flashing content or time-limited content is used, to accommodate slow and seizure-prone users

Understandability:
- The language is consistent and defined as English
- Page changes and form submissions are not caused by focus or input, and behavior is consistent
- IDs and ClassNames are consistent and underlying HTML is not touched to aid accessibility tools
- Most content is text-based to ensure it makes sense without CSS
- Site navigation elements such as buttons and links are described with clear and consise text to ensure their purpose and destinations
  are easily understandable (matches Level AAA link requirement)
- Input fields are labelled clearly, with some placeholder text to provide examples for increased clarity
- Error messages show the full error text to make the causes of the errors clear

Robustness:
- All React JS code is parseable and compliant with ESLint standards
- Minimal use of IDs ensure there are no duplicate IDs
- Only relevant attributes are added to tags
- All interactive elements are assigned their relevant roles/tags as appropriate for the UX
